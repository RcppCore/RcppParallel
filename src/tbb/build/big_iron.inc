# Note that -pthread with xl gives "1501-210 (W) command option t contains an incorrect subargument";
# multithreading is instead achieved by using the _r affix in the compiler name.
# TODO: is -lpthread still relevant/needed with XL and _r affix?

# Note that -D__TBB_NO_DLOPEN is only for scalability,
# and is not necessarily needed by any static build.
