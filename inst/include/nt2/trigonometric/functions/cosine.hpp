    cosine with template selection..

    @par Semantic:

    For template selector in proper selector types choice
    and for every parameter of floating type respectively T0:

    @code
    T0 r = cosine<Range>(x);
    @endcode

    is similar to:

    @code
    T0 r = cos(x);
    @endcode

    but with the limitations and speed-up than can be implied
    by the @c Range choice (see ???)

    @par Notes:
    cosine is a templated version of @c cos,
    the template parameter Range being a mode that allows some control on the computation
    accuracy.

    In fact the control is on the reduction routine of the angle to the
    \f$[-\pi/4, \pi/4]\f$ interval
    they actually are 3 reduction routines protocol that respectly are
    sufficient for small_, medium_ and big_ angle values to have within
    cover test one ulp of difference with the according crlibm result.

    Each one covers respectively intervals \f$[-A, A]\f$ with :
    @code
    |--------------|-------------------|----------------|
    |              |   float  A        |  double  A     |
    |--------------|-------------------|----------------|
    |    small_    |   20*Pi           | 20*Pi          |
    |--------------|-------------------|----------------|
    |    medium_   |   2^6*Pi          | 2^18*Pi        |
    |--------------|-------------------|----------------|
    |    big_      |   Inf             |  Inf           |
    |--------------|------------------------------------|
    @endcode

    In fact for each scalar singleton or simd vector of angles
    There are two possibilities :
    \arg one is to test if all vector element(s) are in the proper range
    for the consecutive increasing values of A until we reach a good
    one or the last :
    the corresponding template tags are small_, medium_ and big_
    \arg the second is to force directly a reduction method
    The corresponding template tags are direct_small_, direct_medium_
    and direct_big_
    @par
    direct_small_ is NOT equivalent to small_ because there are also
    two other methods for \f$[0, \pi/4]\f$ (no reduction)
    and \f$[\pi/4, \pi/2]\f$
    (straight reduction) that are not considered in direct small_

    Note that for float the big_ case is both early an hyper costly and
    shall be avoided whenever possible. To partially achieve this aim
    when double are available on the platform, this part of reduction
    is delegated to the double precision routines.

    @par Advices
    \arg If there is no restrictions ever on your angles and you care for precision
    use nt2::cosine<big_> which is equivalent to nt2::cos
    \arg if you do not care for precision you can use
    nt2::cosine<medium_> or nt2::cosine<small_>
    that will be accurate for their proper range and degrade
    with greater values.

    @par
    Now, the choice of direct or not relies on probabilities
    computations:
    assuming that a vector contains k elements and that testing all
    values that are in an interval takes c cycles and the probability of a value
    to be in interval \f$[a, b]\f$ is \f$p(a, b)\f$
    the number of cycles used by a
    direct\f${}_i\f$ method is simply the reduction time:
    \f$N(\f$direct\f${}_i)\f$
    On the other side the number of cycles for the non-direct methods will have a more
    complicated expression :

    \f$\sum_{i=1}^{m} p(A_{i-1}, A_i)^k N(\f$direct\f${}_i)\f$

    So the non direct methods will be interesting only if you want accurate
    results everywhere and have anyhow a big proportion of small angles.
    This is even more true (if possible) in simd and the more k is big, because
    of the kth power.

    @par For instance in the medium_ float case:

    if angles are equidistributed  on \f$[0, 2^{16} \pi]\f$,
    the \f$p(0, 20\pi)\f$ will be
    less than \f$2^{-11}\f$ and thus in sse2 there will be 1 quadruple over
    1.76e+13 falling in the small_ case...

    Even sorting will do no good because the sort cost will be against
    the ratio of 1 successful quadruplet over 2048.
    \arg  Contrarily if your angles have a gaussian distribution with 0 mean and
    \f$10\pi\f$ standard deviation,  80% of the intervals will be in the "small_"
    case (95% of the values).
    \arg Finally for those that are sure of their angles taking place in a fixed
    range and want speed, three other template tags can be of choice:

                clipped_pio4_,  clipped_small_ and clipped_medium_

    they use the fastest adapted reduction and return Nan for any outsider.
    cosine<clipped_pio4_> have a perhaps still faster equivalent the non template
    nt2::fast_cos.

    @param a0

    @return a value of the same type as the parameter
