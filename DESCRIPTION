Description: High level functions for doing parallel programming with Rcpp.
  For example, the parallelFor() function can be used to convert the work of 
  a standard serial "for" loop into a parallel one and the parallelReduce() 
  function can be used for accumulating aggregate or other values.
Suggests: Rcpp, testthat
